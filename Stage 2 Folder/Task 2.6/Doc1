# Functions of the Top 5 Upregulated and Downregulated Genes (Manual research from GeneCards):

# Top 5 Upregulated Genes: ['EMILIN2', 'POU3F4', 'LOC285954', 'VEPH1', 'DTHD1']
# EMILIN2: Elastin Microfibril Interfacer 2 – Involved in the formation of elastic fibers and anchoring of smooth muscle cells; plays roles in vascular integrity and may induce apoptosis in certain contexts.
# POU3F4: POU Class 3 Homeobox 4 – Neural-specific transcription factor critical for inner ear development; involved in epigenetic signaling and differentiation of neuronal precursors.
# LOC285954: Long non-coding RNA – Poorly characterized lncRNA; potential tumor suppressor activity has been suggested but is not well understood.
# VEPH1: Ventricular Zone Expressed PH Domain Containing 1 – Thought to play a role in brain development; may regulate AKT and TGF-β signaling pathways, though functional studies are limited.
# DTHD1: Death Domain Containing 1 – Contains a death domain; possible involvement in apoptotic pathways, although its function remains largely uncharacterized.

# Top 5 Downregulated Genes: ['TBX5', 'LAMA2', 'CAV2', 'IFITM1', 'TNN']
# TBX5: T-box Transcription Factor 5 – Transcription factor essential for cardiac and limb development; mutations are linked to Holt-Oram syndrome (congenital heart defects and limb malformations).
# LAMA2: Laminin Subunit Alpha 2 – Major component of the basal lamina; crucial for muscle integrity and neuron migration; mutations lead to congenital muscular dystrophy.
# CAV2: Caveolin 2 – Structural protein of caveolae; involved in lipid raft formation, endocytosis, and signal transduction; interacts with caveolin-1 to regulate cell signaling.
# IFITM1: Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein 1 – Mediates antiviral defense by inhibiting viral entry; associated with immune responses and may also play roles in cancer progression.
# TNN: Tenascin N – Extracellular matrix protein involved in axon guidance, skeletal development, and tissue remodeling; modulates cell adhesion and migration.
